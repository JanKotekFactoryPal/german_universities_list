   City as a mandatory field referencing an enumerated list.
   Subject, referencing an enumerated list of fields of study (e.g., Architecture, Mathematics, etc.).
   Requested restructuring of the YAML file to move faculties one level up, making them nodes directly under their universities.
2. Specific Focus on Barbora's Preferences
   Highlighted that Barbora prefers dual vocational training systems (Duale Ausbildung), where she can combine practical experience with academic studies.
   Emphasized future-proof fields that align with societal and technological changes, ensuring her skills remain in demand and not easily replaceable by AI.

   Asked for all faculties to include City as a field, referencing a predefined list of cities.
4. Structuring Data for Long-Term Use
   Requested grouping of universities by city rather than just Berlin and outside Berlin, considering the future possibility of including other cities, even outside Germany.
   Sought flexibility in the data structure to accommodate interdisciplinary programs, specialized study groups, and multiple locations for the same university.
5. Detailed Summary for Decision-Making
   Requested a full display of updated and restructured YAML files with all fields and adjustments.
   Highlighted the need for meaningful descriptions in faculty fields, avoiding placeholders like "Unknown" or "Not Provided."
